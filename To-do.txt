Added "0" as a keyboard shortcut to set zoom to "print preview", i.e. image meta-data PPI / screen PPI.


IDEAS FOR FUTURE VERSIONS:

Bug: Deleting a file from Explorer leaves last index icon hanging.
Bug: Opening a 2nd index for the same folder hangs (only if still parsing the 1st?)

Interface:
- Configurable key and mouse button commands.

- Sort files like Windows (1,2,11, not 1, 11, 2)
- Touch Input support (gestures for next/prev, zoom, rotate, close, open index?)
- More modern look for the tabbed Options dialog.
- Editing support for image meta data.
- "Open with" command list (to open in e.g. external editors).
- Option for a "flow arrangement" of index icons instead of the current "grid arrangement" (in order to fit as much as possible into the available space).
- Support for creating image adjustments "presets" that can be easily recalled, either through a single key-stroke, or in a preset list in the image adjustments dialog.
- Optional image slide-in/out morph when switching images.
- Show (optional) floating toolbar when hoovering over, or pressing on image (touch-sized icons for prev/next/load/index/options/close).

Performance:
- AVX2/AVX support (is this actually slower with current CPU's?).
- Smoother drawing and updating of image windows by using Direct2D.
- Support for GPU computing (pixel shaders?) for even faster resampling.

File formats:
- Support WebP: https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/
